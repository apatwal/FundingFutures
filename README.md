Funding Futures.
By: Abhishiek Karthik, Aditya Patwal, Aum Purohit, and Vashisht Borkar

Our project is based on our eagerness to make a change in the educational system of America. 
We used data from the U.S. Department of Education to analyze the distribution of funds to schools
and the correlation between the funds and the performance of the students.

We created a website that allows users to find a state and find a good distribution of funds depending on how much
funds are available to help fill in the disparity of funds between schools. 

We hope by doing this, we can find VCs that will us support our project.
